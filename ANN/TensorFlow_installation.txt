The size of the weights is the number of inputs times the number of outputs, so k x m. It is extremely important to understand that the weights don’t depend on the number of observations (samples).

The number of biases depends on the number of output variables. Moreover, like the weights, the biases don’t depend on the number of observations.

If the number of inputs is k, the number of outputs is m, and the number of observations n, what is the shape of the biases, b?


Tensorflow installation process:

conda create --name py3-TF2 python=3.10.15

conda activate py3-TF2

conda install tensorflow
pip install upgrade tensorflow
pip install ipykernel

pip show tensorflow: see the tensorflow version
conda info --envs


To add a conda environment to Jupyter (Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab):

At the Anaconda Prompt:

run conda activate <env name>
run conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
run python -m ipykernel install --user --name=<env name>


#############chat gpt####

conda create --name tf_env python=3.8
conda activate tf_env
pip install tensorflow
pip install tensorflow-gpu
python
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
exit()
If you need additional packages (like matplotlib, numpy, pandas, etc.), you can install them using:
conda install <package_name>
conda activate tf_env
conda install jupyterlab
conda install ipykernel

Add the Environment to Jupyter as a Kernel
After installing ipykernel, you need to register your environment as a Jupyter kernel. Run the following command:


python -m ipykernel install --user --name=tf_env --display-name "Python (tf_env)"

verify kernel:
jupyter kernelspec list

Restart JupyterLab
Once you've made these changes, restart JupyterLab and try launching the kernel again:

jupyter lab
